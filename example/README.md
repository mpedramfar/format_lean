# Example

This is a simple example using latest version of `mathlib` with Lean 3.4.1.
To build an interactive webpage from ```src/sandwich.lean```, run :

```
leanpkg build
format_project
```

You can change the options in ```format.toml```, or override them by passing them directly into the ```format_project``` command.
